The following 4 projects were all submitted and presented to members of the Angels during my time working for them in the 2020 season.
1) NOC+ Leaderboard - (Non Contact Leaderboard) a leaderboard of hitters projected BB and K rates using a multiple regression equation to find the value
of each portion of Fangraphs plate discipline in regards to determining an estimated K and BB rate based off swing and take decisions, as well as their contact rates.
I have made some visualizations in R so speed up the ability to take in the data, but it is more accurately understood in spreadsheet/leaderboard form.

2) Pitch Command - the second presentation I did, which was a follow up to my swinging strike rate presentation, covered all aspects of reducing a pitchers
wOBA against not including swinging strike rate.

3) Pitcher Whiff Research- my first presentation for the Angels, mostly built around correlations I found between Trackman pitch data and the pitchers
swinging strike rates, per pitch.  This is entirely based off RHP 2019 data.

4) xSwinging Strike Rate - this was an expected swinging strike rate built using a multiple regression equation based off Trackman data in 2019. You can adjust
individual metrics of a pitcher to give them an idea of who the "stuff" aspect of an individual pitch would change with different pitch attributes.
